# Robot Grid (Game)

## About 
This project is a means to further explore Vue.js and practice building an app using front end technologies. The API repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jdcarey128/robot-game-api) and the deployed game can be found on Netlify [here](https://robot-grid-game.netlify.app/).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Run local server
http://localhost:8080/
```
npm run serve
```
To save high scores when running server locally, run the back end server at the same time on port 3000 (see [API](https://github.com/jdcarey128/robot-game-api) README instructions).

## Future Iterations 
1. Obstacles (difficulty selection)
1. Regain health targets
1. Robot selection 
1. Time selection
